Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For the pirate intelligent agent project, I was provided with a codebase that established the environment and included foundational reinforcement learning structures. I used that to implement my own agent logic, including the decision making algorithms using Q-learning.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve problems using computational thinking, creating algorithms, software, and systems that power technology in nearly every industry. Their work matters because it drives innovation, improves efficiency, and enables solutions to complex real world challenges. Some of these examples include industries such as healthcare, education, transportation, and communication.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The best way to is to approach problems methodically by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components, analyzing patterns, and identifying constraints. Relying on data-driven testing, iterative development, and collaborative feedback to refine solutions allows me to always aim for efficiency, clarity, and scalability.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities include making sure that software is safe, secure, and accessible while protecting user privacy and data. I need to avoid bias in algorithms and be transparent about system limitations, while making sure that my work aligns with the values of integrity, accountability, and social responsibility.
